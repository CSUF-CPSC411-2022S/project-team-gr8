## Background and motivation
In today’s shopping environment, products and options are abundantly available in the market. As consumers ourselves, we look for specific products that cater to our needs. These needs vary due to having inevitable health adversities such as being sensitive to particular ingredients or improving one's specific consumption. 

With that being said, we were motivated to produce a software application that would benefit consumers that would help in narrowing down the types of products that would fit their specific needs. To do so, we aim to create a software application that will incorporate Augmented Reality (AR) to help consumers find products that fit their lifestyle. By incorporating AR, consumers will easily use their phones to point at a particular product, and the software application will help them identify if the product contains or does not contain the ingredients they are looking for. 

Overall, this software application will provide the necessary information that consumers need or do not need in a product by simply pointing their phones towards the product. In doing so, consumers will better understand the product and have a better experience in choosing the right product for them in an abundant market today.
## Summary
A software application that provides users with the convenience of searching for skincare/hygienic products, checking the price of the product on Amazon, shopping for the brand on Amazon, as well as being able to check out more information on the product. Users can also make use of our text recognition scanner to easily search up a product just by pointing their camera at it.
## Features
1. Product Database - This feature aims to provide the user with the necessary information about the product. The software application gets the information about a particular product in this database. As of now, we have found an API that will help us implement this database located here: https://github.com/LauraRobertson/skincareAPI. 
2. Text Recognition Integration - This feature simplifies acquiring information about a specific product by allowing users to use their phone camera at a product and display the necessary information.
3. Search Database - This feature allows the user to enter a keyword and search our database for products and brands pertaining to the user’s input. Users can search by the search bar or search by the brands available in our database.
4. Alternative Product, More Information and Online Shop Options - This feature helps users compare similar products to the ones they’re specifically looking at. It will suggest alternative products available for the user to check out. 
5. Compare Prices with Amazon - This feature will help the user compare the price of the product they’ve scanned to the ones on Amazon.

6. Custom Shape Icons - Using advanced visual design concepts learned in class, we were able to create custom shapes for some of the icons on our interface. Johnson worked on creating icons for the Home icon and AR icon, Maia worked on the Search by Brands Icon and Shop for Same Brand icon, and Tristan worked on the Brand icon.
