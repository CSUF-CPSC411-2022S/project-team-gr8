## Background and motivation
In today’s shopping environment, products and options are abundantly available in the market. As consumers ourselves, we look for specific products that cater to our needs. These needs vary due to having inevitable health adversities such as being sensitive to particular ingredients or improving one's specific consumption. 

With that being said, we were motivated to produce a software application that would benefit consumers that would help in narrowing down the types of products that would fit their specific needs. To do so, we aim to create a software application that will incorporate Augmented Reality (AR) to help consumers find products that fit their lifestyle. By incorporating AR, consumers will easily use their phones to point at a particular product, and the software application will help them identify if the product contains or does not contain the ingredients they are looking for. 

Overall, this software application will provide the necessary information that consumers need or do not need in a product by simply pointing their phones towards the product. In doing so, consumers will better understand the product and have a better experience in choosing the right product for them in an abundant market today.
## Summary
An AR-based application that provides filters for skincare/hygienic products, that rate the given products based upon the user's specific needs or preferences such as any allergies or sensitivities towards certain ingredients.
## Features
1. Product Database (Patricia Ong) - This feature aims to provide the user with the necessary information about the product. The software application gets the information about a particular product in this database. As of now, we have found an API that will help us implement this database located here: https://github.com/LauraRobertson/skincareAPI. 
2. Augmented Reality (AR) Integration (Maia Nguyen) - This feature simplifies acquiring information about a specific product by allowing users to use their phone camera at a product and display the necessary information. We have found that RealityKit by Apple may help us implement this feature.  
3. Ingredients Filter (Johnson Tong) - This feature allows the user to choose specific filters according to their needs and preferences for the product. Examples of such filters include fragrance-free, vegan, or particular ingredients. 
4. Warnings Feature (Tristan Stewart) - This feature warns the user of the harmful ingredients that the product contains. In addition, it will also alert the user of bad ratings that the product has received.
5. Alternative Product Options (Maia Nguyen) - This feature helps users compare similar products to the ones they’re specifically looking at. It will suggest alternative products available for the user to check out. 
6. Compare Prices with Amazon (Patricia Ong) - This feature will help the user compare the price of the product they’ve scanned to the ones on Amazon. 
7. Product Reviews (Tristan Stewart) - This feature will help users provide their opinions on the product and view other reviews of the product.
