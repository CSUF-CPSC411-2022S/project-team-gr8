## Background and motivation
What motivated us to pursue this project is that with so many products and options being available in the market, people are looking for certain products that can cater to their needs. For example, people with certain health adversities such as being sensitive to certain ingredients would benefit from a software application that would help them narrow down the types of products that would fit their needs. We aim to create a software application that will incorporate AR technology to help consumers find products that fit their specific needs. By incorporating AR, users will be able to point their phones at a product and the application will tell them if the product contains or does not contain the ingredients they are filtering for. 
To make better choices by providing health information on a product scanned. To indicate food restrictions. 
## Summary
