// TODO: We need to have a class or struct that handles when the user clicks on a product
//       https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-open-a-url-in-safari
//       Check out this link for info on how to do that.
//       1. In the main views, we can have it so that when the user clicks on the product, it opens the
//          Amazon with a search for the "brand" + "name" of the product
//       2. Also, we might want another one that just does a generic google search for the product,
//          maybe there could be a button labeled "more info" or something whatever floats ur boat
